    "<b>Switch Statements</b>\n",
    "Switch Statements are much faster and effecient then writing a bunch of If Else Statements. A switch statement helps your program make choices based on a value. It checks the values with different cases, like options, and then runs the code for the matching case. If the value is unknown it runs the default option. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Benefits of Using Switch Statements</b>\n",
    "    - Readability: Easier to read and maintain when handling many possible values.\n",
    "    - Efficiency: Faster in some languages, as the implementation often uses a jump table or other optimization\n",
    "    - Structured Approach: Clearly separates conditions into cases.\n",
    "- For Example: If Color is Blue, it prints the color Blue. If Color is Pink, it prints the color Pink. If it is neither, it prints I dont know. \n",
